The **Sidebar Menu** is a steering key feature of the application controlling the visual appearance of 3D molecular visualization. The menu offers the user **various options**. It appears with a while hover on the circle with the three lines/ the side bar and is designed as an **overlay control menu** with the following dropdowns:

- **Protein Data:**
  \
  The first point _Protein Data_ controls the appearance of the protein surface. It allows switching to transparent rendering and to map _chemical properties_ on the surface. It also allows the adjustment of the representation of \_protein residues_and their and text labels.

- **Ligand Data**:
  \
   The dropdown _Ligand Data_ steers whether certain objects are visible in the 3D scene. For example, it enables the representation of the _cluster dodecahedra_, _noise binding poses_, _glyphs_ and more. The _interaction type bar charts_ are summarizing the interaction types of a cluster/binding site and show the relative amount of the individual types regarding the surface area (top bars) and regarding the interaction count of the binding site residues (button bars).

- **Interaction Types: Surface Coloring**:
  \
  It allows enabling and choosing between two color modes. The coloring by interaction type count is based on the number of interactions that points to one AA and applies a linear color scale. The other color mode uses one type-specific hue to color the protein surface that belongs to an AA with an interaction.
- **Interaction Types: Sticks**:
  \
  Sticks give the user an additional possibility of the protein _ligand interaction types visualization_. In comparison to the point before several type types can be visualized **simultaneously**.
- **Clustering: Ligand Binding Poses**:
  \
  Steers the key feature _density based clustering_ of ligand binding poses. After a parameter is changed you have to press **_Enter_** to trigger the recalculation. Then a loading symbol appears until the new data is present.
- **Clustering: Functional Groups**:
  \
  It is very similar to the before mentioned one and controls the _clustering_ and _grouping_ of _functional groups_.
- **Radial Menu**:
  \
  The Radial Menu dropdown allows changing various parameters of the radial menu, like the number of shown ligands, text size and further. It is the central tool for browsing the docking results and the ligand poses of a cluster/binding site.
- **Clip Plane**:
  \
  The last point Clip Plane controls the orientation and the percentage of how many of the protein is clipped. This allows to reduce clutter and to get a better look into binding sites.

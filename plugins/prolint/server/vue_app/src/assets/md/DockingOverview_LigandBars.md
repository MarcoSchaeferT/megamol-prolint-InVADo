The **LIGAND-tab** is an overview too and consists of one larger **bar chart** summarizing the ligands regarding their scores with an adjustable amount of bars (number of ligands against score ranges). It presents the **energy/score distributions** in a scrollable view to browse **small multiples** in form of bar charts of each ligand. This view shows for each ligand the number of models/poses and their various scores. This supports the user, e.g., to judge the docking results and enables comparison tasks by getting an impression about the **score/energy distribution** for the whole docking and also for the individual ligands.
